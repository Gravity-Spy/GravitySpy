Name,Description,Images,No questionBlip,Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shape,blip-1.jpg;blip-2.gif;blip-3.gif,NWhistle,Whistles (a.k.a. Radio Frequency Beat Notes) have a characteristic 'W' or 'V' shape,whistle-1.jpg;whistle-2.gif;whistle-3.gif,NKoi Fish,"Koi Fish are similar to blip glitches, but resemble a fish with a head, fins, and thin tail",koifish-1.jpg;koifish-2.gif;koifish-3.gif,NPower Line (60 Hz),"Power Line are narrow in frequency around 60 Hz and its harmonics (multiples of 60 Hz - i.e. 120 Hz, 180 Hz) and last 0.2-0.5 seconds",powerline-1.jpg;powerline-2.gif;powerline-3.gif,NNo Glitch,"If you do not see any glitch in the image , choose this option",noglitch-1.jpg;noglitch-2.gif;noglitch-3.gif,NChirp,"Chirps are the characteristic shape created by gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, sweeping upwards in frequency over time",chirp-1.jpg;chirp-2.gif;chirp-3.gif,NScattered Light,"Scattered Light are low-frequency, long duration, humpy glitches that usually have several lines stacked on top of each other",scatteredlight-1.jpg;scatteredlight-2.gif;scatteredlight-3.gif,NViolin Mode Harmonic,"Violin modes are short glitches at 500 Hz and harmonics (multiples of 500 Hz - i.e. 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz)",violinmode-1.jpg;violinmode-2.gif;violinmode-3.gif,NLow Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Bursts are short or long bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz",lowfreqburst-1.jpg;lowfreqburst-2.gif;lowfreqburst-3.gif,NNone of the Above,This category is for glitches that do not look like any of the other categories,noa-1.jpg;noa-2.gif;noa-3.gif;noa-4.gif;noa-5.gif;noa-6.gif,N
