Koi Fish are similar to blip glitches, but resemble a fish with a head, fins, and thin tail"Blip,Repeating Blips,"Repeating Blips shown here. Repeating Blips are blips that are observed to repeat, often 0.25 or 0.5 seconds after one another"Blip,Tomte,"Tomte shown here. Tomtes are lower-frequency blip-like glitches that are usually triangular, and look like the hat that would be worn by a garden gnome"Chirp,Blip,Blip shown here. Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shapeChirp,Whistle,Whistle shown here. Whistles (a.k.a. Radio Frequency Beat Notes) have a characteristic 'W' or 'V' shapeChirp,Paired Doves,"Paired Doves shown here. Paired Doves are repeating, chirp-like features that alternate in sweeping up and down in frequency"Koi Fish,Blip,Blip shown here. Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shapeKoi Fish,Tomte,"Tomte shown here. Tomtes are lower-frequency blip-like glitches that are usually triangular, and look like the hat that would be worn by a garden gnome"Koi Fish,Extremely Loud,"Extremely Loud shown here. Extremely Loud are caused by a major disturbance in the detectors, and cover most of the image"Light Modulation,Low Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Burst shown here. Low Frequency Bursts are short bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz"Low Frequency Burst,Low Frequency Line,"Low Frequency Line shown here. Low Frequency Lines occur at very low frequencies, and do not vary in frequency over long durations"Low Frequency Burst,Scattered Light,"Scattered Light shown here. Scattered Light are low-frequency, long duration, humpy glitches that usually have several lines stacked on top of each other"Low Frequency Line,Low Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Burst shown here. Low Frequency Bursts are short bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz"Low Frequency Line,Scattered Light,"Scattered Light shown here. Scattered Light are low-frequency, long duration, humpy glitches that usually have several lines stacked on top of each other"Paired Doves,Chirp,"Chirp shown here. Chirps are the characteristic shape created by gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, sweeping upwards in frequency over time"Paired Doves,Repeating Blips,"Repeating Blips shown here. Repeating Blips are blips that are observed to repeat, often 0.25 or 0.5 seconds after one another"Power Line (60 Hz),Air Compressor (50 Hz),Air Compressor shown here. Air Compressors look like fat lines and occur at a frequency of 50 HzRepeating Blips,Scratchy,"Scratchy shown here. Scratchy glitches are repeated, small glitches at high frequencies"Repeating Blips,Paired Doves,"Paired Doves shown here. Paired Doves are repeating, chirp-like features that alternate in sweeping up and down in frequency"Scattered Light,Low Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Burst shown here. Low Frequency Bursts are short bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz"Scattered Light,Low Frequency Line,"Low Frequency Line shown here. Low Frequency Lines occur at very low frequencies, and do not vary in frequency over long durations"Scratchy,Repeating Blips,"Repeating Blips shown here. Repeating Blips are blips that are observed to repeat, often 0.25 or 0.5 seconds after one another"Scratchy,Wandering Line,Wandering Line shown here. Wandering line glitchess meander slowly in frequencyTomte,Blip,Blip shown here. Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shapeTomte,Koi Fish,"Koi Fish shown here. Koi Fish are similar to blip glitches, but resemble a fish with a head, fins, and thin tail"Violin Mode Harmonic (500 Hz),Whistle,Whistle shown here. Whistles (a.k.a. Radio Frequency Beat Notes) have a characteristic 'W' or 'V' shapeWandering Line,Scratchy,"Scratchy shown here. Scratchy glitches are repeated, small glitches at high frequencies"Wandering Line,Whistle,Whistle shown here. Whistles (a.k.a. Radio Frequency Beat Notes) have a characteristic 'W' or 'V' shapeWhistle,Wandering Line,Wandering Line shown here. Wandering line glitchess meander slowly in frequencyWhistle,Violin Mode Harmonic (500 Hz),"Violin modes are short glitches at 500 Hz and harmonics (multiples of 500 Hz - i.e. 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz)"
