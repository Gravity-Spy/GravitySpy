Name,Twin,Details1080 Line,Violin Mode Harmonic,"Violin Mode Harmonic shown here. Violin modes are short glitches at 500 Hz and harmonics (multiples of 500 Hz - i.e. 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz)"Blip,Repeating Blips,"Repeating Blips shown here. Repeating Blips are blips that are observed to repeat, often 0.25 or 0.5 seconds after one another"Chirp,Blip,"Blip shown here. Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shape"Chirp,Whistle,"Whistle shown here. Whistles (a.k.a. Radio Frequency Beat Notes) have a characteristic 'W' or 'V' shape"Koi Fish,Blip,"Blip shown here. Blips are short glitches with usually a symmetric 'teardrop' shape"Koi Fish,Extremely Loud,"Extremely Loud shown here. Extremely Loud are caused by a major disturbance in the detectors, and cover most of the image"Low Frequency Burst,Low Frequency Line,"Low Frequency Line shown here. Low Frequency Lines occur at very low frequencies, and do not vary in frequency over long durations"Low Frequency Burst,Scattered Light,"Scattered Light shown here. Scattered Light are low-frequency, long duration, humpy glitches that usually have several lines stacked on top of each other"Low Frequency Line,Low Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Burst shown here. Low Frequency Bursts are short bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz"Low Frequency Line,Scattered Light,"Scattered Light shown here. Scattered Light are low-frequency, long duration, humpy glitches that usually have several lines stacked on top of each other"Repeating Blips,Scratchy,"Scratchy shown here. Scratchy glitches are repeated, small glitches at mid and high frequencies"Scattered Light,Low Frequency Burst,"Low Frequency Burst shown here. Low Frequency Bursts are short bursts of low frequency noise, usually lower than about 50 Hz"Scattered Light,Low Frequency Line,"Low Frequency Line shown here. Low Frequency Lines occur at very low frequencies, and do not vary in frequency over long durations"Scratchy,Repeating Blips,"Repeating Blips shown here.
