Welcome to GravitySpy's documentation!
======================================

`Gravity Spy <https://gravityspy.org>`_ is an innovative citizen-science meets Machine Learning meets gravitational wave physics project. This repository is meant to faciliate the creation of new similar citizen science projects on `Zooniverse <https://zooniverse.org>`_
For full details see `Zevin et al. (Classical and Quantum Gravity, 2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/aa5cea>`_

Installing GravitySpy
---------------------

The easiest method to install gravityspy is using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ directly from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Gravity-Spy/GravitySpy.git>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/Gravity-Spy/GravitySpy.git

How to run GravitySpy
---------------------

The main product of this package is the command-line executable `wscan`, which runs an end-to-end search for statistical coincidences, and produces a list of viable data-quality flags that can be used as vetoes in a search, as well as an HTML summary.

To run an analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wscan --inifile my-wini-config-file.ini --eventTime <eventTime> --outDir . --uniqueID --ID 123abc1234 --HDF5 --runML 

where ``<eventtime>`` is the GPS tiem stamp assosciated with an Omicron trigger, and ``./my-wini-config-file.ini`` is the path of your configuration file.

For a full list of command-line argument and options, run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wscan --help

For more details see :ref:`command-line`.
