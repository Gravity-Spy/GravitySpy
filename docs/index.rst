Welcome to GravitySpy's documentation!
======================================

`Gravity Spy <https://gravityspy.org>`_ is an innovative citizen-science meets Machine Learning meets gravitational wave physics project. This repository is meant to faciliate the creation of new similar citizen science projects on `Zooniverse <https://zooniverse.org>`_

The module level docstrings attempt to follow the following format : `Google Style Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/example_google.html>`_


Installing GravitySpy
---------------------

The easiest method to install gravityspy is using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ directly from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Gravity-Spy/GravitySpy.git>`_:

Gravity Spy software has been tested on py35 and py27. Work is in progress to have unit tests verify gravity spy on py27 and py34 py35 and py36. 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/Gravity-Spy/GravitySpy.git

For more details see :ref:`install`.

How to classify unlabeled excess noise
--------------------------------------

One of the main product of this package is the command-line executable `wscan`, which takes an excess noise time makes an omega scan of the event and classifies the image.

To run an analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wscan --inifile my-wini-config-file.ini --eventTime <eventTime> --outDir ./public_html/GravitySpy/Test/ --uniqueID --ID 123abc1234 --HDF5 --runML --pathToModel ../bin

where ``<eventtime>`` is the GPS time stamp assosciated with an Omicron trigger or other time of known excess noise, and ``./my-wini-config-file.ini`` is the path of your configuration file. In the folder Production, is an example of an ini file.

For a full list of command-line argument and options, run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wscan --help

For more details see :ref:`wscan`.

How to train a new model
------------------------

Another main product of this package is the command-line executable `trainmodel`, which serves as an easy wrapper function for training a new Convolutional Neural Net Model (CNN). 

To train a model:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=cuda,floatX=float32 trainmodel --path-to-trainingset <path-to-trainingset> --number-of-classes <number-of-classes>

where ``<path-to-trainingset>`` is a folder that has the structure `"class"/"sampes"` and ``<number-of-classes>`` is how many different classes there are.

For a full list of command-line argument and options, run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ trainmodel --help

For more details see :ref:`trainmodel`.
